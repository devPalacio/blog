### Javascript30 day 19

> Webcam fun?

Today was the longest and possibly most in depth Javascript30 challenge. The goal was to pulll webcam video, display it on a canvas element, add sliders to adjust the canvas image, and then add a 'take picture' button and display the images at the bottom of the canvas. Pretty legit. Learned a lot about the browser again. Maybe I'll be able to do it without watching a video one day.

#### Cloud Genius

Was having some issues accessing the cloud genius written content today, thankfully Nilesh is one of the most responsive people on the internet and got me sorted out quickly.

#### Linux

Zoom screen share is running like :poop: on linux. Apparently nvidia and linux don't get along to well. I think I narrowed it down to v-sync...which is called vblank in linux. Go figure.


#### Coding

My trello-to-etl code is almost in production! After two tough rounds of code review, which were thankfully limited to code smell and style, its almost time for my code to get merged. With that comes a nice DASH bounty. Not bad for 2 months into this thing. I tried to get some work done on the next.js project I'm helping with...but between npm packages, random authentication bugs, and other issues, we really didnt get to do much coding. Possibly realistic?

Anyways, that's all for today, pretty light day overall.
