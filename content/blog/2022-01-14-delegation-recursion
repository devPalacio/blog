### Event Delegation, Recursion, Local Storage & Dash
> Learning about the browser and JS

Today started off pretty good. Continued studying DS&A covering some simple recursion problems. Some pure recursion and some helper function recursion.  

Day 15 of Javascript30 was illuminating. I was exposed to localstorage, the proper usage of `JSON.parse()` & `JSON.stringify()`  and event delegation. Apparently it's just a fancy term for having an event listener on a parent node listening for and acting on events from its children. Pretty simple conceptually once you understand that all events 'bubble up'.

I talked a bit with the Dash Incubator admin Rion, and learned a bunch about the project, and his goals with respect to the trello to github migration. I'm rewatching the videos of AJ making the project to orient myself better in the codebase. I think I'll be able to have something semi-functional by tommorow.
