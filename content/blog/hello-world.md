### An overview of the resources I've found helpful while learning to code.

I seriously started learning on **September 29th 2019**.
_So there's a lot of catching up to do here_

The first resource I started seriously attempting to learn is the famous [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) I took away a lot from it, and actually enjoyed it. I stopped on Week 5, its one of my goals to finish it this year. Learning JavaScript took precedence. It has a ton of breadth and doesn't hold your hand much. Thankfully, there's a million other people that have taken the course and their notes can help when you get stuck.

My current approach (which is probably suboptimal) is to expose myself to as many sources of material as possible, and find the ones that match up with my learning style the most. There's been so many I'm probably forgetting half of them.

After that I came across many  of the 'here's a list of resources that will teach you to be a software developer'. They're everywhere, and various degrees of helpful.

#### In no specific order with some commentary

- [Teach yourself computer science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
  - The first book recommended is [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) (SICP), a title I came across a bunch and tried to get through but the syntax for scheme and the complexity of the material was a bit more than I was ready for at the time.
    - Luckily, a [JavaScript version](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/index) was just released and I'll try to tackle that in the near future.
  - Suprisingly, they recommend [Berkely professor Brian Harvey](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_l28HAzKy0N8) lectures from 2011 for SICP. I got through a couple of them but there's some friction in getting the software set up just right on a modern system for a course that's over 10 years old. I did enjoy his teaching style for the 2 lectures I watched.


- [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) (OSSU)
	-  I just gave this one a cursory glance. It seem's to use python as a first language which hasn't really captured my attention much
	-  From the list, I am working my way though [MIT's The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
		-  It's been tremedously helpful for getting familair with the shell, pipes, aliasing, etc.


-  [Functional CS](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/) & [Learn AI from Scratch](https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/)
	-  I'm not even sure where I came across these two but it's interesting to say the least.
	-  The author AKA anon, strongly believes in CS19 from Brown University and the [PAPL](https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2020/) / [DCIC](https://dcic-world.org/) books make for an incredibly strong foundation for programming. I'm 1/4 of the way through that material, then got distracted by other shiny things to learn. The language taught, Pyret, was designed specifically for beginners and they take a define the problem, infer the data structure and write tests first methodology .
		- You can tell the professor and author, Shriram Krishnamurthi, has put a lot of thought and effort into finding the optimal way to teach programming to beginners. A+ human being.


- Various Udemy Courses
	- My completion rate is 0, but I got exposure to a couple great instructors. It's hard figuring out **what** I need to learn with my current knowledge. Luckily the Air Force provides a free business Udemy account so my out of pocket cost for the 10+ courses I've previewed is $0.
		- I've had the most fun so far following along the [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/?locale=en_US&persist_locale=) by Colt Steele now that I have a decent grasp on JS basics.
	-  I tried learning react and next.js, but I found it hard to understand without a stronger JS background.
-  [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
	-  Very complete text-based resource for learning web development that has a lot of hand picked external resources to help solidify understanding. It can be a bit dry and dense, but it's very comprehensive.
		-  I dabbled in it for a couple days but haven't made it super far.


-  [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
	-  Another challenging but highly recommended book that I found a bit too brief to understand some of the more complex topics. I'm sure I'll revisit it in the near future as my knowledge base grows.
	-  As with most the content I've covered here...I made it about 1/4 of the way though and started going through other resources.
-  Hack Reactor pre-work modules
	-  I start 'Operation Level Up', an active duty military only coding boot camp in Late January.
	-   Part of the admission process was a 20+ hour JavaScript basics 'coding exercises.' These exercises really helped get syntax and the common methods drilled into my head since the problems weren't highly technical, but there was a lot of them.


-   Wes Bos's [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/)
	-   I partnered with a guy from the [Mintbean](https://mintbean.io/meets?sort=upcoming) discord server and we've been working our way though this series this month. It's nice having a partner to learn with.
	-   The course consists of quick 10-20 minute daily toy projects with walkthrough video. To get the most from this course you have to pause and try to figure out the solution on your own.
	-   Since I've spent most my effort learning fundamental JS, this course exposed me to my lack of knowledge in relation to the browser, like event listeners, CSS variables, DOM manipulation, etc. This course helps with that.


-   AJ ONeal's [Beyond Code Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2KJHARTj6KRpKzLU1sVxBA/videos) and [Creed's of Craftmanship](https://github.com/BeyondCodeBootcamp/beyondcodebootcamp/issues/18)
	-   I initially came across his when I found a 'good first issue' posted on twitter that lead to his Webi app. The issue he posted came with clear cut instructions and a video of how to conquer the task. I got my first commit to an open source repo with just minor changes. woot.
	-   AJ also preaches the greatness of Douglas Crockford and and his 8 part series on JavaScript back from 2010. I watched the whole thing and it was amazing for a lot of the 'why is this that way' I had in the back of my head about JS.
	-   He does coding livestreams daily and does a great job of explaining his thought process and interacting with the chat.
	-   This blog is actually built with his Bliss 'set up a blog in 30 seconds' software. So far so good.

That covers almost everything that I've given more than a few hours to. Now to buckle down and actually finish something. I'll try to post a summary of my progress in the future.
