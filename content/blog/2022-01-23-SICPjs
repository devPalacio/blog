### SICP is really hard

Bootcamp begins tomorrow. My last bootcamp was nearly 12 years ago. I've slowed
down my learning pace just a bit to come in nice and fresh. Javascript30 is on
day 25 and today involved some basics in sticky nav. I have a lot to learn
browser-side with CSS. With `transition` `transform` and similar tags, its
ability to animate is impressive.

Due to the high praise it receives, I started reading SICP and skimming the exercises.
I...do not possess the requisite knowledge. The authors have released a JS version so
I don't have to adapt to prefix notation, but it heavily uses the ternary operator.
The first chapter goes into depth on recursion, a couple famous math theorums, and
the construction of loops without ever using the `for` keyword. It's amazing what you
can do with just functions. It has been mentally stimulating trying to comprehend
what the book is putting out. I think MIT would cover just a portion of the book in
a semester, so I imagine I'll be with the book a while.

The code I wrote for the trello-to-github project got used some more by the author, it
is a cool feeling knowing that something I came up with is providing utility.

Anyways, bootcamp starts tomorrow. Hopefully we got a cool cohort and the structure
is conducive to my learning style. Till next time.
