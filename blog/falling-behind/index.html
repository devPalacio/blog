              <p>Check me out on YouTube</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Getting my ass kicked by a cold right now. Anyways, I missed yesterdays post so this might end up being another long retrospective. The highlight of yesterday was becoming YouTube famous and having a well seasoned JS developer guide me while I added a feature to a codebase he created days earlier. The objective is to extract a trello board, transform it into usable data, and load it into to github.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwcXfsgZ12A&amp;t=3315s">Watch me here</a>&hellip;warning. It goes for nearly 4 hours. At the end of it we did manage to implement the feature we were going for, we just hit a few speed bumps along the way</p>
            <p>Key takeaways for me:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You have to really understand the codebase before you go adding features, at one point we went through line by line to confirm my understanding</li>
              <li>variables are free, use them! I would keep trying put way too much logic into one line, and I could see AJ dying inside. it makes code more readable, for yourself and the next guy.</li>
              <li>be mindful of your private tokens! I opened my .env file with my github token on stream&hellip;and immediately had to go revoke it. oops.</li>
              <li>sanity check your logic and scope. I implemented a couple minor logic errors that got corrected on the spot. We ended up needing more data than intended in a function, so we had to add an argument to the 3 parent functions. I&rsquo;m still a bit lost on that one.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Today I continued but without supervision on the ETL project. Yesterday laid a solid foundation which I could build upon. I managed to implement slightly more complex logic in a little bit less time. It was the first time I added to and utilized a module. As a bonus, my code was way more readable. UPDATE: after running the code for a bit&hellip;there&rsquo;s a pesky bug somewhere that&rsquo;s resulting in duplicate fields. Almost had it.</p>
            <p>Also did 2 days of JavaScript30 since my last post.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Both days required video help :(</li>
              <li>
                Day 16 involved having a css text shadow follow your mouse cursor
                <ul>
                  <li>That requires good familiarity with offsetX, offsetY, offsetTop, offsetLeft, and some clever math to keep the shadow on a leash</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Day 17 involved sorting an array but ignoring words such as the, a and an.
                <ul>
                  <li>The implementation was just use the .replace method with a small regex <code>(/^(a |the |an )/i, &quot;&quot;)</code> and when running the sort method, just call your new &lsquo;strip&rsquo; function when comparing a to b. Array stays whole, only time string gets manipulated is during the comparison.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s all I care to write about today. Til tomorrow.</p>
